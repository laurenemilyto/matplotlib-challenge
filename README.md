# matplotlib-challenge

Description
Used pandas and matplotlib to analyze anti-cancer pharmaceutical study results in 249 mice identified with SCC tumor growth. In this study, mice were treated through a variety of drug regimens. Analysis looks at correlation between drug regimens and final tumor volume across mice.

Insights:
- Drug Regimens Capomulin and Ramicane were given to the most mice, and were also some of the most effective treatments in reducing tumor growth, based on average tumor volume, standard deviation and variance.
- There is a positive relationship, and strong correlation (.82) between mouse weight and tumor volume. This demonstrates mouse weight may be a factor contributing to tumor volume.
- Drug Regimen Ketapril resulted in the greatest variance of tumor volume (68.5), positioning it as one of the least effective regimens. For comparison, Capomulin had a variance of 24.9.
